# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-03)

**Core value:** Any analyst can load the dashboard and immediately see which vessels are highest risk — with enough context to understand why and act on it.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Database Decomposition

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-Phase 1]: Dual SQLite/PostgreSQL backend preserved through this milestone; db/ decomposition must not break SQLite local dev path
- [Pre-Phase 1]: All callers use `import db; db.fn()` pattern — re-export surface in __init__.py must be complete before db.py is deleted (Pitfall B2)
- [Pre-Phase 2]: APScheduler 3.x selected over Celery+Redis; no new Railway services beyond existing PostgreSQL
- [Pre-Phase 4]: flask-talisman force_https=False required for Railway TLS termination at edge proxy

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2] APScheduler double-refresh with 2 Gunicorn workers — resolve during Phase 2 implementation (advisory lock or reduce to 1 worker on hobby tier)
- [Phase 4] Flask-Limiter PostgreSQL storage URI format — Railway uses postgres:// scheme; limits library may require postgresql://; verify during Phase 4 implementation before assuming it works
- [Phase 4] CSP inline script audit scope unknown — count of templates with {{ data | tojson }} inside <script> tags unknown; audit is first task of Phase 4 to size the work
